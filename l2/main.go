		Concurrency is the most important feature of Go,and the principle is

		In this exercise you need to catch many features of channels.This is a tour for you to figure out!
		Because here the focus is pipleline model (link:http://blog.golang.org/pipelines).
		It's different from the custom parallel vector sum in which sum numbers at every index of the vectors in a goroutine.
		In this exercies,vector is just a abstract,you can change it to a struct or any thing else that can be sumed up.
